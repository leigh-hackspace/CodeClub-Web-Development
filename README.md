# CodeClub-Web-Development
This repo contains basic templates for the web dev 


# IDE
You can use any IDE to write HTML even a basic text editor like notepad.

To keep it simple on these examples we have used VScode and the live server extention.

There are some template sites in so show examples of how to combine the elements that we have previously learned about.
